# Solana Vote DApp (Anchor)

A decentralized voting application built on **Solana** using the **Anchor framework**. This program supports proposal creation, voting, treasury initialization, token minting, and winner declaration, with clear on-chain state separation and event emission.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

* **Treasury-backed voting**: A treasury is initialized with its own mint (`x_mint`) and token account.
* **Proposal-based governance**: Users can create proposals and vote within a deadline.
* **On-chain accounting**: All proposals, voters, counters, and winners are stored as program accounts.
* **Event-driven**: Key actions emit events for off-chain indexing.

## 🚀 Instructions

### 1. Initialize Treasury

Initializes the core treasury configuration, mint, and counters.

**Instruction**: `initialize_treasury`

**Accounts**:

* `authority` – Program admin
* `treasury_config_account` – Stores treasury config
* `x_mint` – SPL token mint for voting tokens
* `treasury_token_account` – ATA holding minted tokens
* `proposal_counter_account` – Tracks proposal IDs
* `sol_vault` – PDA to receive SOL
* `mint_authority` – PDA mint authority

**Parameters**:

* `sol_price: u64` – Price of tokens in SOL
* `tokens_per_purchase: u64` – Tokens minted per purchase

---

### 2. Buy Tokens *(WIP)*

Allows users to buy voting tokens by transferring SOL to the vault and receiving `x_mint` tokens.

**Instruction**: `buy_tokens`

> ⚠️ Logic partially implemented. Expected flow:
>
> 1. Transfer SOL from buyer → vault
> 2. Mint `x_mint` tokens to buyer

| declared_at         | i64          | Timestamp     |

---

## 📣 Events

Emitted for off-chain consumers and indexers.

* **`ProposalCreated`** – On proposal creation
* **`VoterAccountClosed`** – When voter account is closed and rent recovered
* **`SolWithdrawn`** – When SOL is withdrawn from treasury

## ❌ Error Codes

### Voting Errors

* `InvalidDeadline`
* `ProposalEnded`
* `ProposalNotEnded`
* `NoVotesCast`
* `VotingStillActive`
* `UnAuthorized`

### Proposal Errors

* `ProposalAlreadyExists`

### Counter Errors

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Solana**
* **Anchor Framework**
* **SPL Token / Associated Token Program**

## 🔐 Security & Audit Notes

* PDA seeds are used consistently for treasury, mint authority, and vaults
* Proposal counter overflow is guarded
* Authority checks enforced via stored pubkeys
* Deadlines are validated using on-chain timestamps

---

## 📌 TODO / Improvements

* Complete `buy_tokens` instruction
* Add vote casting & winner declaration instructions
* Add SOL withdrawal logic
* Add integration tests
* Expand proposal ID size beyond `u8`
